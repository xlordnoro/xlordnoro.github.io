This repository was created to streamline the css/js required for posts due to the recent wordpress update which is absolute shit xD

August 22, 2020 - Created the repository (index, slider, playcool's version, css styles, etc.)

March 11, 2021 - Added reverse_slider_code.js

May 13, 2021 - Added the three_button_styles.css and three_button_slider.js

May 20, 2021 - Added creep_keypress.js

Jan 9, 2022 - Added three_button_slider_movie.js

Jan 26, 2022 - Added comment.css to make the css code in the various tables easier to read. Probably won't add the js code unless I'm willing to grind it out which is pointless when it already works fine as is.

March 24, 2022 - Added creative_workshop.js & creative_workshop.css to accomodate J0my's banner contributions into the post.

April 9, 2022 - Added ssstylish.css for testing mass-post css modifications along with spicy_keydown.js and pervert_keydown.js for the BD's of season 2 for Arifureta.

April 18, 2022 - Added fancy_hover.css and nyaa_keydown.js to show a nice cat maid cover image on the otome game post.

April 23, 2022 - Added yuki_keydown.js to show a Christmas cover image on the Kakkou no Iinazuke post.

September 17, 2022 - Added shuumatsu_no_harem_keydown.js to show a Christmas cover image on the Shuumatsu no Harem post.

September 22, 2022 - Added pansy_keydown.js & cosmos_keydown.js to show a Pansy and Cosmos cover image on the oresuki post.

September 27, 2022 - Removed the singular keydown .js files for arifureta & oresuki which were replaced with combined variants that contained both jquery functions inside them to reduce load times on posts and ease of use over all. The new filenames are arifureta_keydown.js & oresuki_keydown.js.

Continued - Added about_us.css & about_us.js files containing the external code needed for the about us post to function properly after the 5.0 update.

October 12, 2022 - Added flip_flapper_keydown.js to show an easter egg in the flip flappers post.
